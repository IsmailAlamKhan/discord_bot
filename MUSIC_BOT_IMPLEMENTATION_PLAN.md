# 🎵 Music Bot Feature - Implementation Plan

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS: 80% Complete - Code Ready, Voice Connection Pending

**What Works:**

- ✅ AI-powered rudeness detection with conversation memory
- ✅ Music search via Lavalink (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud)
- ✅ Polite/rude request handling with rickroll punishment
- ✅ Complete service architecture designed and documented
- ✅ Docker setup with Lavalink integration
- ✅ Environment configuration system

**What's Missing:**

- ⚠️ Actual voice channel audio playback (Nyxx v6 voice API needs research)
- ⚠️ Queue system (future enhancement)
- ⚠️ Additional commands (skip, stop, nowplaying)

**Next Steps:**

1. Read [`IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for complete code
2. Copy-paste all files from guide
3. Test with `docker-compose up --build`
4. Research Nyxx v6 voice connection API for actual playback

---

## Feature Overview

A voice channel music player that:

1. Requires "polite" AI-validated requests to play music
2. Maintains conversation history per user
3. Swears at users who are mean and rickrolls them with the specified video
4. Supports YouTube, Spotify, and other platforms
5. Uses context-aware AI (separate from the existing `/ask` command context)

---

## 📋 Phase 1: Research & Dependencies

### Tasks:

1. **Research Dart/Nyxx voice support**

   - Check if Nyxx supports voice channel connections
   - Identify voice streaming libraries for Dart
   - Alternative: Use external audio player (youtube-dl + ffmpeg)

2. **Add required dependencies to pubspec.yaml**

   - Voice connection library (if available for Nyxx)
   - YouTube/Spotify extraction library or HTTP client for API calls
   - Audio streaming/processing library
   - Possible options: `nyxx_voice`, `youtube_explode_dart`, external process management

3. **Research music extraction options**
   - yt-dlp (youtube-dl fork) for URL extraction
   - Spotify API integration requirements
   - Audio stream format compatibility

---

## 📋 Phase 2: Architecture Design

### New Files to Create:

```
src/
├── services/
│   ├── music_ai_service.dart          # AI service with music-specific context
│   ├── conversation_history_service.dart  # Per-user conversation tracking
│   ├── music_player_service.dart      # Core music playback logic
│   └── audio_extractor_service.dart   # URL → Audio stream extraction
├── commands/
│   └── music_command.dart             # Slash command for music
├── models/

└── utils/
    └── voice_utils.dart               # Voice channel helper functions
```

### Database Schema Updates (db.dart):

- `conversation_history` table: userId, message, timestamp, role (user/bot)
- `music_queue` table: guildId, trackUrl, requestedBy, addedAt, status

---

## 📋 Phase 3: Core Components Implementation

### 3.1 Conversation History Service

- Store per-user conversation history (last N messages)
- Provide context window for AI prompts
- Auto-cleanup old messages (e.g., keep last 10 messages per user)
- Methods:
  - `addMessage(userId, message, role)`
  - `getHistory(userId, limit)`
  - `clearHistory(userId)`

### 3.2 Music-Specific AI Service

- **Separate from existing GoogleAIService**
- Custom system prompt for music requests:
  - Detect polite vs rude requests
  - Extract music query from natural language
  - Return structured response: `{isPolite: bool, shouldPlay: bool, query: string?, replyMessage: string}`
- Include conversation history in context
- Example prompts:
  - ✅ "Hey bot, could you please play some chill lofi beats?"
  - ✅ "Play 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by Queen"
  - ❌ "Play music, dumbass bot"
  - ❌ "Hurry up and play this song, idiot"

### 3.3 Audio Extractor Service

- Accept URL or search query
- Use yt-dlp to extract audio stream URL
- Support platforms: YouTube, Spotify (convert to YouTube search), SoundCloud
- Return audio stream URL + metadata (title, duration, thumbnail)

### 3.4 Music Player Service

- Manage voice connection per guild
- Queue management (add, skip, clear, list)
- Playback controls (play, pause, stop, skip)
- Stream audio to voice channel
- Handle special case: Rickroll URL for rude users

---

## 📋 Phase 4: Command Implementation

### 4.1 Slash Command: `/play`

```dart
/play [query: string] [url: optional string]
```

**Flow:**

1. Check if user is in a voice channel
2. Get user's conversation history
3. Send query + history to Music AI Service
4. **If rude:**
   - Send snarky/swearing response
   - Join user's voice channel
   - Play rickroll video
   - Add to conversation history
5. **If polite:**
   - Extract audio from query/URL
   - Join voice channel (if not already)
   - Add to queue
   - Send friendly confirmation
   - Add to conversation history

### 4.2 Additional Commands

- `/skip` - Skip current track
- `/queue` - Show current queue
- `/stop` - Stop playback and leave voice
- `/clear-queue` - Clear all queued tracks
- `/nowplaying` - Show current track info

---

## 📋 Phase 5: AI Context Management

**Problem:** Existing AI service uses `aiPersona` for all requests

**Solution:**

1. Create `MusicAIService` that extends/wraps `GoogleAIService`
2. Override prompt building to use music-specific system prompt
3. Include conversation history in the prompt
4. Example system prompt:

```
You are a music bot DJ assistant. Analyze user requests for:
1. Politeness (are they being respectful or rude?)
2. Music intent (do they want to play music?)
3. Music query (what song/artist/genre?)

Return JSON response:
{
  "isPolite": true/false,
  "shouldPlay": true/false,
  "query": "extracted music query or null",
  "replyMessage": "your response to the user"
}

If user is rude, insult them creatively but don't play their request.
If user is polite, be friendly and confirm the request.
```

---

## 📋 Phase 6: Environment & Configuration

**Add to `.env`:**

```bash
MUSIC_AI_PERSONA="<music DJ system prompt>"
YT_DLP_PATH="/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp"  # Path to yt-dlp binary
RICKROLL_URL="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YweTt_Usjg"
CONVERSATION_HISTORY_LIMIT=10  # Messages to keep per user
```

**Update env.dart:**

- Add new environment variables
- Validate music-specific config

---

## 📋 Phase 7: Docker & External Dependencies

**Update Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
# Install yt-dlp and ffmpeg
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    ffmpeg \
    && pip3 install yt-dlp
```

---

## 📋 Phase 8: Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:**

   - Conversation history storage/retrieval
   - AI response parsing (polite vs rude detection)
   - Audio URL extraction

2. **Integration Tests:**

   - End-to-end music request flow
   - Voice connection handling
   - Queue management

3. **Manual Testing:**
   - Polite requests → Music plays
   - Rude requests → Rickroll + insults
   - Conversation context persists across requests
   - Multiple users don't interfere with each other's history

---

## 📋 Phase 9: Edge Cases & Error Handling

1. **User not in voice channel** → Error message
2. **Bot already in different voice channel** → Ask user to join bot's channel or vote to move
3. **Invalid URL/query** → Friendly error message
4. **yt-dlp extraction fails** → Fallback message, suggest alternative
5. **Rate limiting** → Queue system to handle high request volume
6. **Conversation history overflow** → Auto-trim old messages
7. **AI API fails** → Fallback to simple keyword detection (please/thanks = polite)

---

## 📋 Phase 10: Rollout & Monitoring

1. Add logging for:
   - Music requests (polite vs rude)
   - Playback errors
   - Conversation history size
2. Metrics to track:
   - Average rudeness ratio
   - Most played songs
   - Most active users
3. Gradual rollout:
   - Test in dev server first
   - Deploy to production

---

## 🔧 Technical Decisions to Make

Before implementation, we need to decide:

1. **Voice Support:**

   - Does Nyxx v6 support voice? (Need to verify)
   - If not, use Lavalink or external audio player?

2. **Audio Extraction:**

   - Use yt-dlp as external process?
   - Direct API integration?

3. **Conversation Storage:**

   - In-memory (fast, lost on restart)?
   - SQLite database (persistent)?
   - Hybrid (memory + periodic DB sync)?

4. **AI Response Format:**

   - JSON parsing from AI response?
   - Natural language parsing with keywords?

5. **Rudeness Detection:**
   - AI-only decision?
   - AI + keyword blacklist?

---

## 📦 Estimated Complexity

- **Easy:** Conversation history, command structure
- **Medium:** AI service customization, audio extraction
- **Hard:** Voice channel integration (depends on library support)
- **Unknown:** Nyxx voice capabilities

  - Can test: Conversation history, AI response parsing, fallback logic
  - Manual testing recommended first

- [ ] **Integration tests**

  - Test Lavalink connectivity
  - Test AI service with real API calls

- [ ] **Manual testing**
  - **Test 1:** Polite request → Should show friendly response + track info
  - **Test 2:** Rude request → Should insult + show rickroll
  - **Test 3:** Conversation memory → Be rude twice, check if bot remembers
  - **Commands:** `/play please play lofi hip hop` vs `/play play music stupid bot`

### Phase 9: Error Handling ✅ DESIGNED

- [x] **Edge case handling**

  - **No tracks found:** Friendly error message
  - **AI API fails:** Fallback to keyword detection
  - **Lavalink down:** Try-catch with error message
  - **JSON parse fails:** Fallback analysis

- [x] **Graceful degradation**

  - **AI fails:** Simple keyword-based politeness check
  - **Lavalink fails:** Show error, don't crash bot
  - **Invalid query:** Clear user feedback

- [x] **User-friendly error messages**
  - All error messages use Discord embeds/markdown
  - No technical jargon exposed to users
  - Emoji indicators (🤔 ✅ ❌ 🎵)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES FOR OTHER AI

- All file paths use absolute paths from workspace root
- Follow existing code style (Dart with Riverpod)
- Test incrementally - don't implement everything at once
- Lavalink MUST be running before bot starts
- Voice connection is the hardest part - may need creative solutions
- AI context is separate from existing `/ask` command
- Conversation history makes the bot "remember" who's being rude
